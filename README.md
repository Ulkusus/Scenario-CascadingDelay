# Scenario: Cascading Delay

Part of the masters thesis "Integrating Explanation Generation into the Palladio Tool Chain".   
Please check there for further documentation.

A multi-service application with greedy response time thresholds scales out each service individually one after the other.
This results in the total response time remaining too high for longer than if all services scaled together.
**Currently incomplete due to Slingshot being in active development!**
